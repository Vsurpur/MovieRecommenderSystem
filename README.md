# MovieRecommenderSystem
I have made a Content Based Movie Recommender System where you enter the movie you have watched or a movie you like and the system will recommend 5 movies based on the input.

Dataset : I have used the TMDB 5000 Dataset for this project.

As it is a Content Based System the model works on the tags which I have provided to it and recommends movies based on those tags.

For the tags I have combined the Genres, Synopsis, Top 3 Cast Members and Directors into a single tag and then Vectorized the text.
